                  <p> * Leading a team of ASP.NET using VB.NET programmers on managed tasks for several divisions in Inktel and meeting tough schedules with quality as our number one goal. We worked integrating several companywide systems with databases from companies like Sprint, Bellsouth, and BankOne. Worked with a team on several projects often taking the lead and creating team wide systems to be used on all future and current projects. All projects were a combination of ASP &amp; ASP.NET using VB.NET, with MS SQL using T-SQL as the database. There were several web services from the client companies that required XML and XSLT. All web pages used JavaScript and CSS. Several of the systems were n-tiered and I personally created not only the client tiers but several of the middle tiers as well </p>
